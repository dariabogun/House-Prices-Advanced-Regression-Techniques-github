# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Setup:
  1) You will need to have `numpy`, `pandas`,`sklearn` and `matplotlib`.
  2) The data set is from Kaggle and can be downloaded from this repo.

### That is all, I hope you enjoy!
